### Known Bugs

While working on the header and carousel I founded difficult to fit fit the size of images and navbar inside the grid-system chosen. 
I got overflow on all devices. This has been fixed using photoshop to resize images and Bootstrap grid-system with offset class to fit the navbar.

It was not easy during the project fit all contents inside the small size screen, that's why i created a media query for all screen sizes.

The major difficulty has been try to place contents with grid-system. I the beginning I used property such us: margin-left, right to move the contents, in all screen sizes.
During the projects I started to use bootstrap grid-system offset classes to place the contents without use often the property box.

The form in sign up page was not working and required attribute even. My mistake was to not include all form inside the form element.
This has been fixed.
