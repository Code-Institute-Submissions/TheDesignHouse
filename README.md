### Testing

The website was testing in Google Chrome, Microsof edge  and Opera browser.

The website was viewed on different devices such as: laptop, iphone 11 pro, iphone 8 sony xperia x1 compact, sony xperia xa ultra.

### Known Bugs

While working on the header and carousel I found difficult to adapt the size of images to their own element. The most difficult part was the overflow obtained in all types of devices and to adapt the navbar to the chosen grid-system. This has been fixed using photoshop to resize the images and Bootstrap grid-system with offset class to fit the navbar.

During the project, it was not easy to fit all contents inside small sized screen devices, and that's why I thought it was appropriate to create a media query for all screen sizes.

It was very hard to locate contents with the grid-system. In the beginning, I used property such as: margin-left, right to move the contents, in all screen types.

During the projects I started to use bootstrap grid-system offset classes to place the contents without often using the property box.

The form inside the sign up page, as well the attribute required were not working initially- My mistake was to not include the input elements and button  inside the form element. This has then been fixed.
