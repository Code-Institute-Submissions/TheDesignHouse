# Homepage

## Carousel
* When you open the website the carousel take a big space with these slides of bright pictures is the welcome door and the view to attracts users. 
Is responsive and fluid with the controls.

## main message
* Main message located in the center is the first impact that the users eyes see. Is big and has a good impact (in my opinion)

## footer
* Large view, very intuitive with 3 sections the grey color match the whitesmoke background body colour.
* Here you can easily find the social icons with a light gray hover colour on the black. 
For carry on with icons consistency i decided to add icons to the contact area.
* The join us section to sign up is set up with a internal link with green hover colour, perfect to invite users and also goes straight to the sign up page with the sign uo form is located, not complicated very intuitive.

## Desktop view 




## colors

* For to keep the colour style and do a good contrast, from the whitesmoke body background color, to footer and other elemenet such as logo, navbar I decided for black and for the contents inside footer I got black as well.

## hover

* The hover pseudo-class is present inside the footer in every pages, on the icons, the <p> with interior link below join us, and  the sign up button located on the sign up page below the newsletter form.
The colour chosen on the icons is a rgba black color with 0.5 of transparency that makes a pretty good contrast.
For the <p> I chosen a green color for attract and invite the users to click on.
The sign up button comes with green color as well the reasons to use it are the same for the <p> above.

# Project

* The page is made up with 3 work project images and project explenation where 3 external links to wikipedia are located and marked. 
The reason to mark up the links is to make the user curious and discover more about the interior style.
