 When you open the website the carousel take a big space with these slides of bright pictures is the welcome door and the view to attracts users. 
Is responsive and fluid with the controls.
## main message
 Main message located in the center is the first impact that the users eyes see. Is big and has a good impact (in my opinion)
## footer
1. Large view, very intuitive with 3 sections the grey color match the whitesmoke background body colour.
2. Here you can easily find the social icons with a light gray hover colour on the black. 
For carry on with icons consistency i decided to add icons to the contact area.
3. The join us section to sign up is set up with a internal link with green hover colour, perfect to invite users and also goes straight to the sign up page with the sign uo form is located, not complicated very intuitive.
