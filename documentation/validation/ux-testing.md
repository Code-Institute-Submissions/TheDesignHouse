# Homepage

## Carousel
* When you open the website the carousel takes a big space with these slides of bright pictures is the welcome door and the view to attracts users. 
Is responsive and fluid with the controls.

## main message
* the Main message located in the centre is the first impact that the users' eyes see. Is big and has a good impact (in my opinion)

## footer
* Large view, very intuitive with 3 sections the grey colour match the whitesmoke background body colour.
* Here you can easily find the social icons with a light grey hover colour on the black. 
To carry on with icons consistency I decided to add icons to the contact area.
* The join us section to sign up is set up with an internal link with green hover colour, perfect to invite users and also goes straight to the sign up page with the sign up form is located, not complicated very intuitive.

## Desktop view 




## colours

* For to keep the colour style and do a good contrast, from the whitesmoke body background colour to footer and other elements such as logo, navbar I decided for black and for the contents inside footer I got black as well.

## hover

* The hover pseudo-class is present inside the footer on every page, on the icons, on the paragraph with the interior link below join us, and the sign up button located on the sign up page below the newsletter form.
The colour chosen on the icons is a rgba black colour with 0.5 of transparency that makes a pretty good contrast.
For the paragraph, I chose a green colour to attract and invite the users to click on it.
The sign up button comes in green colour as well the reasons to use it are the same for the paragraph above.

# Project

* The page is made up of 3 work project images and project explanation where 3 external links to Wikipedia are located and marked. 
The reason to mark up the links is to make the user curious and discover more about the interior style.
