# VAlidation testing

## Homepage (index.html)

* The first time I have run the html5 validation test for index.html the document came out with one error. 
The presence of section tag inside heater tag. This has been promptly fixed and when I have run the test for the second time, the document came out without errors.

# Sign up (sign up.html)

* The sign up page came out with no errors but one warning about a section tag. The validator device me to use header tag such us: h1,h2 etc...
I didn't modify the page and run another test because I found the warning minimal and doesn't affect my codes.

# Css (style.css)

The first time that I run, the test came out with some errors such as: 2 value inside the text-align property (justify and centre) multiple times. 
I fixed deleting the justify value. I run the test for the second time and came out with no errors.
