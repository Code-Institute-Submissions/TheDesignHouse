# VAlidation testing

## Homepage (index.html)

* The first time I have run the html5 validation test for index.html the document came out with one error. 
The presence of section tag inside heater tag. This have been promply fixed and when I have run the test for the second time, the document came out without errors.

# Sign up (sign up.html)

* The sign up page came out with not errors but one warning about a section tag. The validator device me to use header tag such us: h1,h2 etc..
I didn't modify the page and run another test becuase I founded the warning minimal and doesn't affect my codes.
